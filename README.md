# React Testing Library Custom Render
This project demonstrates how you can make a reusable custom render function for testing components that rely on React's Context, with the flexibility of using default context, or the specified context in an individual test senario, and with the further added benefit of returning a user object (for user events) and a queryClient object if using React Query.
